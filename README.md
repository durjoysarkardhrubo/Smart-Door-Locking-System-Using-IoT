## Overview

The **Smart Door Locking System** is an IoT-based solution designed to enhance the security and convenience of door access control. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi, servo motor, and a web interface, this system allows users to remotely lock and unlock their doors from anywhere with an internet connection. Additionally, it provides local control through physical buttons or a keypad.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Lock and unlock your door via a web interface accessible through smartphones or computers.
- **Local Control:** Physical buttons or a keypad for manual locking/unlocking.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitor the status of your door (locked/unlocked) in real-time.
- **Basic Security:** Implement basic authentication to protect against unauthorized access.

## Components Required

1. **Raspberry Pi** (with Raspbian OS installed)
2. **Servo Motor** (e.g., SG90) for controlling the lock mechanism
3. **Push Buttons** or **Keypad** for local input
4. **Wi-Fi Module** (if not using Raspberry Pi with built-in Wi-Fi)
5. **Jumper Wires**
6. **Breadboard**
7. **Power Supply**
8. **Resistors** (for button pull-down/up configurations)

## System Architecture

- **Hardware Control:** The servo motor is connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to control the locking mechanism.
- **Local Input:** Push buttons or a keypad allow manual locking/unlocking.
- **Web Interface:** A Flask-based web server allows remote control via a smartphone or computer.
- **Security:** Basic authentication can be added to secure the web interface.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi** with Raspbian OS installed.
- Python 3.x installed on the Raspberry Pi.
- Internet connection for the Raspberry Pi.
- Necessary hardware components connected as per the system overview.
